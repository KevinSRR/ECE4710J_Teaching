    "## 0.1 What is Matplotlib?\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is basically a Multiplatform visualization library for data that is built on NumPy Arrays. This Library is designed to work with the broader SciPy stack, which includes different modules of Python used for machine learning and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matplotlib is the default(sort of) Python Data Visualization Package.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As Matplotlib is a visualization library, these visualizations allow us to represent huge amount of data in visual form like charts and plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matplotlib is useful in creating 2D plots from the data in Arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matplotlib library is inspired by MATLAB programming language and it also provides a similar interface like MATLAB for graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This library gets easily integrated with the Pandas package which is used for data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the combination of Pandas and Matplotlib data wrangling can be done along with the visualization and one can get valuable insights out of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matplotlib library in Python is mainly known as Grammer of Graphics and it is the most used library for creating charts and plots in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matplotlib can be used with Jupyter Notebook, web server Applications, and IPython shells.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was written by John D. Hunter in 2003 and it was born with its 0.1 version. Matplotlib received an early boost at the time when it was adopted as the plotting package of choice by the Space Telescope Science Institute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.2 Important Modules in Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important modules in Matplotlib Library and these are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![structure](./assets/struc.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2.1 pyplot\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is an important module in Matplotlib. In our further tutorials in code examples, you will often see matplotlib.pyplot being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This module mainly provides us an interface that allows us to automatically and implicitly create figures and their axes to achieve the desired plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is a great module when you quickly want to plot something without the instantiation of any figure or any axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2.2 pylab\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is another important module of Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You need to install this module alongside the matplotlib module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Module pylab helps to import NumPy and pyplot and it is recommended when you need to work with arrays, perform mathematical operations, and you want to access the plotting features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is not recommended in case you are using IPython Kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2.3 Matplotlib, pyplot and pylab: how are they related?\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is the whole package; matplotlib.pyplot is a module in matplotlib; and pylab is a module that gets installed alongside matplotlib.\n",

    "- \\w -- (lowercase w) matches a \"word\" character: a letter or digit or underbar [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Note that although \"word\" is the mnemonic for this, it only matches a single word char, not a whole word. \\W (upper case W) matches any non-word character.\n",
    "- \\b -- boundary between word and non-word\n",
    "- \\s -- (lowercase s) matches a single whitespace character -- space, newline, return, tab, form [ \\n\\r\\t\\f]. \\S (upper case S) matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "- \\t, \\n, \\r -- tab, newline, return\n",
    "- \\d -- decimal digit [0-9] (some older regex utilities do not support \\d, but they all support \\w and \\s)\n",
    "- ^ = start, $ = end -- match the start or end of the string\n",
    "- \\ -- inhibit the \"specialness\" of a character. So, for example, use \\. to match a period or \\\\ to match a slash. If you are unsure if a character has special meaning, such as '@', you can put a slash in front of it, \\@, to make sure it is treated just as a character.\n",

    "Suppose you are trying to match each tag with the pattern '(<.*>)' -- what does it match first?\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a little surprising, but the greedy aspect of the .* causes it to match the whole `<b>foo</b> and <i>so on</i>` as one big match. The problem is that the .* goes as far as is it can, instead of stopping at the first > (aka it is \"greedy\").\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an extension to regular expression where you add a ? at the end, such as .\\*? or .+?, changing them to be non-greedy. Now they stop as soon as they can. So the pattern '(<.\\*?>)' will get just `<b>` as the first match, and `</b>` as the second match, and so on getting each <..> pair in turn. The style is typically that you use a .\\*?, and then immediately its right look for some concrete marker (> in this case) that forces the end of the .*? run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *? extension originated in Perl, and regular expressions that include Perl's extensions are known as Perl Compatible Regular Expressions -- pcre. Python includes pcre support. Many command line utils etc. have a flag where they accept pcre patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "An older but widely used technique to code this idea of \"all of these chars except stopping at X\" uses the square-bracket style. For the above you could write the pattern, but instead of .\\* to get all the chars, use [^>]\\* which skips over all characters which are not > (the leading ^ \"inverts\" the square bracket set, so it matches any char not in the brackets)."
